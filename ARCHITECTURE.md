# ARCHITECTURE.md — atlas

System design for **atlas**, an agent-first enterprise workspace. This document describes the
layered architecture, the agent orchestration graph, how state / memory / approvals work, and the
key design trade-offs. For project rules and constraints see [`CLAUDE.md`](./CLAUDE.md).

---

## 1. Philosophy: agent-first

Traditional software puts apps at the center and bolts AI on top. **atlas inverts this.** A single
unified agent is the primary interface; apps become **tools** the agent orchestrates. The agent's
intelligence compounds through two knowledge graphs:

- **Personal Knowledge Graph (PKG):** per-user context, history, preferences.
- **Organizational Knowledge Graph (OKG):** company-wide knowledge, RBAC-scoped.

Because the agent takes **real, irreversible actions**, the architecture is built around a
**human-in-the-loop approval gate** and an **append-only audit trail**.

## 2. Layered Architecture

### Layer responsibilities

| Layer | Responsibility | M1 status |
|---|---|---|
| **Interface** | HTTP surface; stream responses; expose approve/reject | deferred (M2+) |
| **Agent Orchestration** | Stateful graph: plan, gate, execute, respond | **built (M1)** |
| **Integration** | Declare tools (name, args schema, **risk tier**), run them | built (mock tools) |
| **Knowledge** | RBAC-scoped read/write of PKG + OKG | interface + stub (M2) |
| **Data** | Durable state checkpoints + audit persistence | memory/SQLite (M1), Postgres (M2) |
| **Governance** | `requires_approval` policy, RBAC, audit, confidence | policy + audit (M1) |
| **Observability** | LangSmith traces + evals | env-enabled (M1) |

## 3. Agent Orchestration Layer (the core)

A LangGraph `StateGraph` with four nodes and conditional routing.

    planner -->|only auto actions| executor
    planner -->|no actions| responder
    approval -->|interrupt → human → resume| executor
    executor --> responder

             └──────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

### Node responsibilities

- **planner** — Reads the request (and, later, PKG/OKG context). Proposes tool calls. For each
  proposed call, the tool's **declared** `RiskTier` is looked up from the registry. *(LLM-driven
  when an API key is present; deterministic heuristic otherwise, so the system runs offline.)*
- **approval** — If any proposed action requires approval, calls `interrupt({pending_actions})`.
  The graph **pauses durably**. A human resumes with `Command(resume=<decisions>)`. Decisions are
  **bound to `action_id`**; decisions for unknown ids are ignored.
- **executor** — For each proposed action, **re-checks** the policy and (if gated) a matching
  approval **before** running it. Auto (READ) actions run directly; gated actions run only if
  approved. Produces `ActionResult`s.
- **responder** — Synthesizes the final answer with **sources** and a **confidence** score.

## 4. State Model

Graph state is a `TypedDict` (LangGraph channels), with structured values as **frozen** Pydantic
models. Only `messages` uses a reducer; other channels are last-write.

```
AgentState:
  messages:            list[AnyMessage]   # reducer: add_messages
  proposed_actions:    list[ProposedAction]
  approved_action_ids: list[str]
  rejected_action_ids: list[str]
  action_results:      list[ActionResult]
  sources:             list[str]
  confidence:          float | None
```

Action contracts (`frozen=True`, immutable):

```
RiskTier         = READ | WRITE | SEND | DELETE | PAY
ProposedAction   = { action_id, tool, args, risk_tier, rationale }
ApprovalDecision = { action_id, approved, decided_by }
ActionResult     = { action_id, tool, ok, output, error }
```

## 5. Memory Model

- **Short-term (working memory):** the checkpointed thread state above, keyed by `thread_id`.
  Durable across process restarts — this is what makes a paused approval survive.
- **Long-term (compounding memory):** PKG + OKG behind a `KnowledgeGraph` repository interface.
  Reads are RBAC-scoped by the caller's principal. Concrete backend (Neo4j / pgvector) is chosen in
  M2; an in-memory stub stands in for now.

## 6. Approval Workflow (HITL)

```mermaid
sequenceDiagram
    participant U as Human
    participant G as Graph (LangGraph)
    participant P as Policy
    participant A as Audit (append-only)

    G->>P: requires_approval(risk_tier)?
    P-->>G: yes (SEND/WRITE/DELETE/PAY or unknown → fail-closed)
    G->>A: record(PROPOSED, action_id)
    G->>U: interrupt({pending_actions})   %% graph pauses durably
    U-->>G: Command(resume=[{action_id, approved}])
    G->>A: record(APPROVED|REJECTED, action_id, decided_by)
    G->>G: executor runs only approved + auto actions
    G->>A: record(EXECUTED, action_id, result)
```

The gate is enforced **in the executor**, not merely by graph shape: even if routing changed, the
executor refuses to run a gated action without a matching, in-scope `ApprovalDecision`.

## 7. Persistence & Checkpointing

- A **checkpointer factory** returns: `PostgresSaver` if `DATABASE_URL` is set (M2) → else
  `SqliteSaver` if a path is configured → else `InMemorySaver`.
- A checkpointer is **required** for `interrupt()`/resume to work.
- Audit events are append-only: in-memory in M1, a durable store (`persistence/audit_store.py`) in
  M2. Hash-chaining is noted as future tamper-evidence hardening.

## 8. Governance & Security

- **Risk classification is deterministic and tool-owned** — never inferred by the LLM.
- **Fail-closed** everywhere risk is uncertain.
- **Append-only audit** is the system of record for "who approved what, and what happened".
- **RBAC** scopes every knowledge read (defense against IDOR / privilege escalation).
- **Secrets** come only from env via Pydantic `Settings`.

## 9. Key Design Decisions & Trade-offs

| Decision | Alternative | Why we chose it |
|---|---|---|
| LangGraph `interrupt()` for HITL | Custom approval queue/state machine | Durable, battle-tested, less code to get wrong on the security-critical path |
| `TypedDict` channels + Pydantic payloads | Full Pydantic graph state | Matches LangGraph idioms (reducers) while keeping records type-safe & immutable |
| Tool-declared risk tiers | LLM-classified risk | Removes the model from the trust boundary; resists prompt injection |
| Fail-closed default | Fail-open (auto-run unknown) | Security posture: unknown ⇒ ask a human |
| Approval bound to `action_id` | Boolean "approved" flag on state | Prevents stale/replayed approvals authorizing a different action |
| KG behind an interface | Commit to Neo4j/pgvector now | Defer an expensive, hard-to-reverse infra decision; keep orchestration testable |
| Postgres checkpointer (M2) | Stay on SQLite | Production durability + concurrency for enterprise use |

## 10. Roadmap

- **M1 (this milestone):** runnable HITL core — policy, mock tools, the four-node graph, in-memory
  audit, SQLite/memory checkpointer, LangSmith via env, demo + tests.
- **M2:** Postgres checkpointer + durable append-only audit store; RBAC; Knowledge Graph interface
  wired into the planner; confidence/source maturation; simple gate-correctness evaluation hooks.
- **Later:** FastAPI Interface endpoints; concrete KG backend; real integrations (Gmail/Slack/Jira);
  auth/SSO; hash-chained audit.
